# Malicious_File_indexer

Malicious_File_indexer project is the brain behind the next-get ransomware. Instead of encrypting everything on the hard drive, we will only encrypt business-valuable files (it is up to the malicious actor to decide).
To do so, we need a way to efficiently target import files.
For some organizations valuable files will be word documents (.docx), for some hi-res pictures (.png) and for others their code base (.cs, .cpp, .java, â€¦).

Disclaimer - the code was written for study purposes only, and must not be used for malicious purpuses.

# Files Description:

 Malware.py:
 
    A class in charge of retrieving the Master File Table (MFT) record for an NTFS file system
    and send it off to the attack server over TCP in a compressed manner.
    Serves as an initial stage for the upcoming ransomware.
 
 CnCServer.py:
 
    Command and Control Server. a class in charge of operating a server, which waits for the MFT data from the
    malware and every newly arrived MFT, it will map, according to the users input of desired file extensions,
    the paths of files, which correspond to the desired file extension.
    Prints to the log, for each file the src IP, a timestamp and a full file path.
 
 MFTFieldsExtractor.py:
 
    A class in charge of extract file paths from the MFT table and parse it. Making use of analyzeMFT package

  ========
  
  Please install the following library:
  
  analyzeMFT
  
  Installation methods:
  
      pip install analyzeMFT
      
      Alternatively:
      
      git clone https://github.com/dkovar/analyzeMFT.git
      
      or download it from here: https://pypi.org/project/analyzeMFT 
  
  ========
  
  In order to run the project, you will have to run the CnCServer.py first, and then Malware.py .
  Running CnCServer.py will activate the Command and Control Server, which will wait for the Malware.py to send it the compressed MFT file.
  After the Malware.py finishes to run, you will have to enter the desired file extension, and the magic will happen.
  The CnCServer.py will stay running waiting for more requests.
